# devops_projects
To create and learn devops projects

This case here uses vagrant and virtualbox to create a web server that can be used to deploy our weeb application locally onto our system. The best part is we can get this done locally.

We used here Vagrant and virtualbox. Virtualbox for creation of VM and Vagrant for automation.

Using vagrant we created our virtual machine with using virtualbox as a base. The vagrantfile here basically has the specification of the VM that we have used.
Inside the VM, we got installed the apache server in order to help deploy our web app. The beauty about it is we can access the web server created in our vm into our local machine's browser.

The key focus here was to learn about automation and deployment of our application, and that too without any usage of GUI, using only command-line arguments.
